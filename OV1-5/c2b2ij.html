  That sales can be increased by the presence of sunlight within a store has been shown by the experience of the only Savefast department store with a large skylight. The sky-light allows sunlight into half of the store, reducing the need for artificial light. The rest of the store uses only artificial light. Since the store opened two years ago, the depart-ments on the sunlit side have had substantially higher sales than the other departments.
